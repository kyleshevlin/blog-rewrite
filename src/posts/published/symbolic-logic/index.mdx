import { FootnoteMarker as Marker } from '../../../components/Footnotes'

For as long as I can remember, I have been pedantic when it comes to logic. I'll give an example. Recently, the US Navy confirmed that videos with unexplainable phenomena <Marker index={1} content="Notice I do not say UFO" /> were authentic Naval videos. Many people jumped to the conclusion that this confirms that aliens exists. This is false.

Aliens could exist. Or they could not. The videos do not provide enough logical propositions to prove or disprove alien existence. All they prove is that unexplainable phenomena exist. It could be that aliens visited in an aircraft. It is equally as likely <Marker index={2} content="Logically speaking, that is. When a proposition does not prove something, all explanations are equal, even if some aren't as plausible as others." /> that the phenomena is humans from the future visiting us in an aircraft.

You can imagine with this level of pedantry for logic that I'm a big hit at dinner parties. It probably comes as no surprise that I double majored in Philosophy and Mathematics in undergrad. In my course work, I took a class on Symbolic Logic. Symbolic logic, sometimes referred to as propositional logic, is a form of logic in which propositions are reduced to an algebra. This post is me sharing the knowledge of that course, taught with some psuedo-code, so we can learn a bit of Latin and know a bit more about the logical assumptions we make in our day to day work.

### Entailment

The first thing we need to learn is an entailment proposition. Simply put, it's an if-this-then-that statement. I'm going to write entailment propositions like so:

```
A => B
```

We can read this as "`A` entails `B`" or "if `A` is true, then `B` is true."

### _Modus Ponens_

Building on [Entailment](#entailment), it reasons that the next step is to make _use_ of our entailment proposition, by

### _Modus Tollens_

### Hypothetical Syllogism
